        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Rooted in Portland. Inspired by the Wild.</h3>
        <p> We started our journey in Portland, Oregon—a city where rain-soaked forests, rugged coastlines, and volcanic peaks sit right in our backyard. Here, the outdoors isn’t just a weekend escape; it’s a way of life. Our company was born from that same spirit: a belief that every person deserves access to high-quality outdoor gear that protects the landscapes we love.</p>
        <h3>Our Mission: Explore Responsibly</h3>
        <p>We design durable, versatile outdoor products that empower people to explore more while leaving less behind. Sustainability guides every step—from the materials we source to the partners we choose to the way we operate our workspace. Our goal is simple: gear that performs in the field without harming the field.</p>
        <h3>How We Make a Difference</h3>
        <h4>Sustainable Materials</h4>
        <p>We prioritize recycled, upcycled, and responsibly harvested materials. By reducing dependence on virgin resources, we minimize waste while extending the life cycle of our products.</p>
        <h4>Ethical Production</h4>
        <p>We work with manufacturing partners who uphold strict environmental and labor standards. Transparency matters to us, and we’re committed to building a supply chain that reflects our values.</p>
        <h4>Local Roots, Global Impact</h4>
        <p>From community cleanups in Forest Park to collaborations with Pacific Northwest conservation groups, giving back is woven into our identity. Every purchase directly supports regional restoration projects.</p>
        <h3>Built for the Pacific Northwest—and Beyond</h3>
        <p>Our designs reflect the unpredictable terrain and weather of the PNW. Whether you’re navigating misty trails, climbing basalt cliffs, or camping under starlit skies in the high desert, our gear is built to keep up—and built to last.</p>
        <h3>Why We Do It</h3>
        <p>We believe that protecting the planet isn’t optional. It’s essential. The outdoors teaches us to move more slowly, breathe more deeply, and notice more fully—and we’re here to help preserve those moments for generations to come.</p>
        <h3>Join Us Outside</h3>
        <p>We’re more than an outdoor company; we’re a community of people who value nature, sustainability, and thoughtful adventure. Lace up your boots. Pack lightly. Step outside with purpose.</p>
        <h4>Let’s explore—responsibly.</h4>
